Space Technology in Everyday Life | Typesetting Literature Project | Applied Art for Web

This project focuses on typography and colour. We were to choose any text by any author. It could be a passage from your favourite novel, a poem or an article. No images are allowed in this project and so the text allows for detailed styling and typesetting.
