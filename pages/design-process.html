    <p>While trying to achieve the pinnacle of humankind, the technology has quickly cascaded down to our everyday
        lives and has influenced the birth of a modern technological age.</p>
    <h2>The Source</h2>
    <p>The source the project is an extended extract from an article titled “How Technology
        From the Space Race Changed the World” posted on 9th April 2020 at Now website, which is owned by Northrop
        Grumman - a multinational aerospace and defence company. The website examines a vast array of technological
        topics and trends and how they intersect with daily life. This is where writers take on complex topics and make
        them accessible to everyone.</p>

    <h2>The Colors</h2>
    <p>When we talk Space, we talk about a lot of colors. Thousands of pictures taken by telescopes have shown the
        vastness of the universe and the variety of colors that make it up. Millions of Nebulae, made of bright and
        beautiful colors in the nothingness of space.</p>
    <p>The choice of my colors are simple and self-explanatory, and yet integrates the flavour of our space being a vast
        entity. Colors used in the background, fonts and navigation are emblematic of the concept.</p>
    <p>The color palette infuses shades in grayscale, like the typical dark-mode black and white. In addition, the
        subtle use of the shades of sky blue signifies the immediate association with "What is up there?" factor.</p>
    <h2>The Font</h2>
    <p>The Font Stack I have targeted for the project includes "Manrope", "Urbanist", "Oswald", Arial and Helvetica.</p>
    <p>I used Oswald primarily for the navigation where it suits the best. It sits well to give the feel of a website
        that talks about astronomy.</p>
    <p>Urbanist and Manrope is used for the headings and the paragraphs respectively. Urbanist as a heading gives a
        modern feel to the website since the content is driven toward the present and the future. Manrope, acting as a
        font which has high readability and a light tone just solves the puzzle overall.</p>
    <p>The Urbanist and Manrope also act as fallbacks to each other in their respective implementations, including Arial
        and Helvetica.</p>
