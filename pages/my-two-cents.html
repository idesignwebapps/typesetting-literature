    <p>When we see the creativity and technology around us, and just look at the origins, it is surprising to
        learn how a race between two nations has lead up to the development of things that have been so helpful to us.
    </p>
    <h2>The Good</h2>
    <p>Space is vast, and the curiosity to learn what is “out there” is something I have always had since childhood. As
        it turns out, that I was not the only one. The space race was a 20th century competition between the Cold War
        rivals USA and the USSR to achieve superior spaceflight capabilities and dominate space exploration.</p>
    <p>Clearly, it has helped the technology used up there in our day-to-day life. From the invisible teeth braces, to
        memory foams. From smoke detectors, to show insoles. A lot has come out of from space exploration that has
        changed lifestyle of generations.</p>
    <p>The hunger to know more about the universe, and our existence, will always lead to new discoveries, inventions,
        solutions to our modern problems.</p>
    <h2>The Ugly</h2>
    <p>While we discuss about the benefits of space exploration, there is no hiding when it comes to the dark side of
        it.</p>
    <p>The book "Accessory to War: The Unspoken Alliance Between Astrophysics and the Military" which is authored by
        popular astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson with writer Avis Lang, talks and explores the use of space as a
        weapon and how the use of satellite intelligence and militarisation of space is taking place.</p>
    <p>While one could argue it is a matter of national security, others can see it as an undirected and misguided use
        of weaponary by space capable countries over the less developed ones. Any form of an arms race is harmful, and
        this one is no different.</p>
